<h2>Original Social Security Card</h2><!-- the Second subheading-->
	<!--contents for this subheading-->
	<p>To apply for an original card, you must provide at least two documents to prove age, identity, and U.S. citizenship or current lawful, work-authorized immigration status. If you are not a U.S. citizen and do not have DHS work authorization, you must prove that you have a valid non-work reason for requesting a card. See page 2 for an explanation of acceptable documents.</p>
	<p>NOTE: If you are age 12 or older and have never received a Social Security number, you must apply in person.</p>

<h2>Replacement Social Security Card</h2><!-- the Third subheading-->
	<p>To apply for a replacement card, you must provide one document to prove your identity. If you were born outside the U.S., you must also provide documents to prove your U.S. citizenship or current, lawful, work-authorized status. See page 2 for an explanation of acceptable documents.</p>

<h2>Changing Information on Your Social Security Record</h2><!-- the Forth subheading-->
	<p>To change the information on your Social Security number record (i.e., a name or citizenship change, or corrected date of birth) you must provide documents to prove your identity, support the requested change, and establish the reason for the change. For example, you may provide a birth certificate to show your correct date of birth. 
	A document supporting a name change must be recent and identify you by both your old and new names. If the name change event occurred over two years ago or if the name change document does not have enough information to prove your identity, you must also provide documents to prove your identity in your prior name and/or in some cases your new legal name. 
	If you were born outside the U.S. you must provide a document to prove your U.S. citizenship or current lawful, work-authorized status. See page 2 for an explanation of acceptable documents.</p>

		<u>LIMITS ON REPLACEMENT SOCIAL SECURITY CARDS</u><!--add underline for this subheading-->
	</h3>
</body>
	<p>Public Law 108-458 limits the number of replacement Social Security cards you may receive to 3 per calendar year and 10 in a lifetime. Cards issued to reflect changes to your legal name or changes to a work authorization legend do not count toward these limits. We may also grant exceptions to these limits if you provide evidence from an official source to establish that a Social Security card is required.</p>
