	<p>
		Protect your SSN card and number from loss and identity theft. DO NOT carry your SSN card with you. Keep it in a secure location and only take it with you when you must show the card; e.g., to obtain a new job, open a new bank account, or to obtain benefits from certain U.S. agencies. Use caution in giving out your Social Security number to others, particularly during phone, mail, email and Internet requests you did not initiate.

</body>
<p>
	Sections 205(c) and 702 of the Social Security Act, as amended, authorize us to collect this information. The information you provide will be used to assign you a Social Security number and issue a Social Security card.
</p>
<p>
	The information you furnish on this form is voluntary. However, failure to provide the requested information may prevent us from issuing you a Social Security number and card.
</p>
<p>
	We rarely use the information you supply for any purpose other than for issuing a Social Security number and card. However, we may use it for the administration and integrity of Social Security programs. We may also disclose information to another person or to another agency in accordance with approved routine uses, which include but are not limited to the following:
</p>
<p>
	&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; 1. &emsp; To enable a third party or an agency to assist Social Security in establishing rights to Social Security benefits and/or coverage; <!--the 1st routine provided-->
</p>
<p>
	&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; 2. &emsp; To comply with Federal laws requiring the release of information from Social Security records (e.g., to the Government Accountability Office and Department of Veterans' Affairs); <!--the 2nd routine provided-->
</p>
<p>
	&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; 3. &emsp; To make determinations for eligibility in similar health and income maintenance programs at the Federal, State, and local level; and <!--the 3rd routine provided-->
</p>
<p>
	&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; 4. &emsp; To facilitate statistical research, audit or investigative activities necessary to assure the integrity of Social Security programs. <!--the 4th routine provided-->
</p>
<p>
	We may also use the information you provide in computer matching programs. Matching programs compare our records with records kept by other Federal, State, or local government agencies. Information from these matching programs can be used to establish or verify a person's eligibility for Federally-funded or administered benefit programs and for repayment of payments or delinquent debts under these programs.
</p>
<p>
	Complete lists of routine uses for this information are available in System of Records Notice 60-0058 (Master Files of Social Security Number (SSN) Holders and SSN Applications). The Notice, additional information regarding this form, and information regarding our systems and programs, are available on-line at <a href="url">www.socialsecurity.gov</a> or at any local Social Security office.<!--create a hyperlink in this paragraph-->
